# Soil Respiration Project

This repository contains files for a consulting project regarding soil respiration rates. The client's research focused on a particular type of observation from each file, so data were merged from thousands of `csv` files where the location of the specified observations varied between files. The code used to do this and a sample file can be seen here.
